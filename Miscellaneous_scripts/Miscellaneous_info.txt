Scripts that has been used only for specifi case debugging, 
testing or just used once for the whole time of the project (but still important to keep)

Clean_checkpoints.py:
	Script to clean the pytorch model so it can be loaded with trust_remote_code = False.

Prepare_weights.py:
	Preparation of the weights for final submission (it was academic project). It cleared all states of the optimizer etc.
	and left only weights releveant to the model working

ResNet_backbone.py:
	Download locally the resenet model (so its not somewhere throwed in the PC cache).
	Resnet was used as backbone for image feature extraction

View_dataset.py:
	Viewing the test dataset. Testing the pipeline - what the model would get as the input data

Test_tokenizer_cases.py:
	Testing different cases of text input to the tokenizer. Encoding and decoding.
	To see it preprocessing, lemmatization works.
